# The Economic Impacts of Minimum Wage Incrreases in Europe

## Project Overview
The relationship between minimum wage increases and economic indicators like inflation, unemployment, and purchasing power parity (PPP) has been a long-standing debate among policymakers, economists, and labor advocates. In recent years, several European countries have implemented significant changes to their minimum wage policies, making it a timely issue to explore.

This project examines how changes in minimum wage levels impact three critical aspects of the economy. Specifically, the analysis focuses on answering the following research question: How do changes in minimum wage affect inflation, unemployment, and purchasing power parity across Europe?

This project combines time series analysis with visualizations in Tableau to examine data from various European countries. Some of the key questions this project addresses include:

- What trends have minimum wages followed in Europe over the past 14 years, and how have they varied across countries?
- How does the minimum wage relate to the PPP index in different countries, and how does this affect workers' real purchasing power?
- 
- Does an increase in minimum wage lead to higher unemployment rates due to the increased cost of hiring for businesses?


The findings presented in this analysis are especially relevant for governments and organizations considering the introduction or increase of minimum wage laws, providing data-driven insights into the broader economic implications.

## Key Findings

### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

One of the key questions in this analysis is whether or not an increase in the minimum wage translates into a higher real purchasing power for workers. To evaluate this, we compare:

- **Nominal minimum wage:** the official minimum wage set by each country in euros. Since some countries calculate wages over 14 payments per year, this analysis standardizes all values to a 12-payment system for consistency and comparability.
- **PPP-Adjusted Minimum Wage:** measure that adjusts the minimum wage based on purchasing power parity (PPP), allowing for fair comparisons between countries by considering differences in the cost of living. A higher PPP-adjusted wage means workers can afford more goods and services.
- **PPP Index:** a measure of how expensive a country is relative to others. A higher PPP Index means a higher cost of living, reducing the real value of wages. A lower PPP Index means the cost of living is lower, allowing wages to stretch further.

Over the period from 2012 to 2023, the majority of European countries have experienced consistent increases in their minimum wage levels. These increases reflect broader efforts to enhance workers' earning potential and reduce income inequality across the continent.

As shown in the graph below, which was created using Tableau, all countries in the dataset have seen upward trends in their minimum wage levels over the years. While the rates of increase have varied significantly by country, the general trend is clear: wages have been rising across Europe in response to economic and political pressures.




This graph provides a visual representation of the year-over-year growth in minimum wage rates for several European countries from 2012 to 2023, illustrating the regional differences and the pace of wage growth in each nation. This historical trend sets the stage for the analysis in this project, which investigates whether these wage increases have successfully improved the purchasing power parity (PPP) for workers in different countries.
