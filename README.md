# The Economic Impacts of Minimum Wage Increases in Europe

## Project Overview
The relationship between minimum wage increases and economic indicators like inflation, unemployment, and purchasing power parity (PPP) has been a long-standing debate among policymakers, economists, and labor advocates. In recent years, several European countries have implemented significant changes to their minimum wage policies, making it a timely issue to explore.

This project examines how changes in minimum wage levels impact three critical aspects of the economy. Specifically, the analysis focuses on answering the following research question: How do changes in minimum wage affect inflation, unemployment, and purchasing power parity across Europe?

This project combines time series analysis with visualizations in Tableau to examine data from various European countries. Some of the key questions this project addresses include:

- What trends have minimum wages followed in Europe over the past 14 years, and how have they varied across countries?
- How does the minimum wage relate to the PPP index in different countries, and how does this affect workers' real purchasing power?
- 
- Does an increase in minimum wage lead to higher unemployment rates due to the increased cost of hiring for businesses?


The findings presented in this analysis are especially relevant for governments and organizations considering the introduction or increase of minimum wage laws, providing data-driven insights into the broader economic implications.

## Key Findings

### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

One of the key questions in this analysis is whether or not an increase in the minimum wage translates into a higher real purchasing power for workers. To evaluate this, we compare:

- **Nominal minimum wage:** the official minimum wage set by each country in euros. Since some countries calculate wages over 14 payments per year, this analysis standardizes all values to a 12-payment system for consistency and comparability.
- **PPP-Adjusted Minimum Wage:** measure that adjusts the minimum wage based on purchasing power parity (PPP), allowing for fair comparisons between countries by considering differences in the cost of living. A higher PPP-adjusted wage means workers can afford more goods and services.
- **PPP Index:** a measure of how expensive a country is relative to others. A higher PPP Index means a higher cost of living, reducing the real value of wages. A lower PPP Index means the cost of living is lower, allowing wages to stretch further.

As shown in the graph below, created using Tableau, all countries in the dataset have experienced consistent increases in their minimum wage levels between 2012 and 2023. While the rates of increase have varied significantly by country, the overall pattern is clear: wages have been growing across Europe in efforts to improve workers' earnings and reduce income inequality across the continent.

This graph shows the annual increase in minimum wages in 2012, 205, and 2023 of the year-over-year growth in minimum wage rates for several European countries. This historical trend sets the stage for the analysis in this project, which investigates whether these wage increases have successfully improved the purchasing power parity (PPP) for workers in different countries.

Now that we know the wage trend has been positive and growing, let's explore whether these increases have led to better purchasing power for workers. To do this, we adjust the minimum wage using the PPP index, allowing for a fair comparison between countries.

In the graph below, we show the relationship between each country's PPP index and its minimum wage adjusted for PPP. Some interesting insights emerge. For example, having the highest nominal minimum wage doesnâ€™t necessarily mean having the highest purchasing power. Ireland is a good example of this. Although it has one of the highest nominal minimum wages, it also has the highest PPP index (meaning the cost of living is also very high). As a result, its minimum wage adjusted for PPP is lower than that of other high-income countries.

This creates a gap between minimum wage and the cost of living, leaving Irish workers with less real purchasing power compared to workers in countries like Spain or Poland. Despite these countries having much lower nominal wages, their minimum wage increases have outpaced the growth of their PPP index, giving their workers a stronger minimum wage relative to other countries.

In contrast, some countries like Luxembourg show a more consistent relationship between the PPP index and increases in the minimum wage.
